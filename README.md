# SimpleMVC

## What is it?

SimpleThreading is a set of classes to ease your multithreading.  
There is a very simple ThreadBlock class to work with that 
allows you to get a result from each delegate call, unlike the ActionBlock Microsoft
provides.

Please read the [documentation](https://simplethreading.gatewayprogramming.school) online.
